                        who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright
                        law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by this Site infringe your copyright,
                        you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to
                        it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) A physical or electronic
                        signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
                        allegedly infringed; (b) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
                        (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a
                        representative list of such works); (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be
                        infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow
                        us to locate the material on the Site; (d) The name, address, telephone number and email address
                        (if available) of the complaining party; (e) A statement that the complaining party has a good
                        faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
                        copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) A statement that the information in the
                        notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized
                        to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>

                        against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must
                        meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see

                        under the DMCA. We reserve the right to terminate the account of any user that is a copyright
                        infringer.</p>
